##### Version v.0.1.1

1. bug fix: in `onPushRun.m` the adiabatic quality p was incorrectly calculated when the total simulation time exceeded the actual switch-off ramp time
2. bug fix: both axes for the pulse frequency and current modulation are now show correctly when exporting the *Current View* figure from the menu
3. new feature: an animation of the latest result can be played for all parameter combinations (e.g. *Pulse + Relaxation* or *Pre-polarization switch-off + Pulse + Relaxation*, etc.)
4. typo fixing within comments and `README.md`
